# LRC Powertool
LRC Powertool is an editor for .LRC files that represent synchronized lyrics (song lyrics together with the time for every line).

## Features
* Create .LRC files by listening through the song and clicking in sync with the song
* Preview .LRC files
* Import unsynchronized lyrics from .TXT to synchronize
* Add offset to all added lyric lines to take delay into account
* Add blank lines easily at any time
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Support for .LRC metadata: artist, album, title, length, lyricist, LRC creator, global offset
* Automatic metadata entry

## Caveats
* No support for enhanced .LRC (word-for-word timings)
* Keyboard shortcuts are fixed and cannot be edited
